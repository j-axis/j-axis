Welcome to my repository! 

My name is Kevin Hoang. Iâ€™m a Drafting Detailer looking to add more automation skills to my tool belt, mainly by exploring C# and various database management systems. I'm currently an undergrad studying intros to ArcGIS, C#, GitHub, Java and SQL programming alongside basic electronic devices theory, characteristics and industrial applications.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone interested in sharing CAD or programming knowledge and tips or those interested in the computer-integrated manufacturing and design automation areas of focus.

Fun fact: still compiling...
