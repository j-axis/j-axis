## Hi thereğŸ‘‹

<!--
**j-axis/j-axis** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ”­ Welcome to my repository! My name is Kevin Hoang. Iâ€™m a Drafting Detailer looking to add more automation skills to my toolbelt, mainly through exploring C# and various database management systems.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently a student studying intros to ArcGIS, C#, GitHub, Java and SQL programming alongside basic electronic devices theory, characteristics and industrial applications.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone who's interested in sharing CAD or programming knowledge and tips, or with those interested in the computer-integrated manufacturing and design automation areas of focus.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...still compiling...
